# 🎵 Spotify Website Clone

### ✨ Overview

The Spotify Website Clone is a front-end project that replicates the design and core interface of Spotify’s music streaming platform. This clone captures Spotify's dark-themed, minimalistic aesthetic and provides a familiar user experience, showcasing features like the music library, playlists, and search functionality. Through this project, I aimed to replicate Spotify's layout and interactivity, refining my front-end skills.

### 🚀 Features

- **🎶 Homepage Layout:** A familiar homepage with sections for recently played tracks, popular playlists, and suggested artists.
- **🔍 Search Functionality:** Allows users to explore music content by artist, album, or genre with a simulated search experience.
- **📚 Library and Playlists:** Displays a user’s simulated library with playlists, albums, and liked songs, similar to the official Spotify interface.
- **🎧 Player Controls:** Bottom player bar with controls for play, pause, skip, and volume, mimicking Spotify’s in-app music controls.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Fully responsive, providing an optimized experience on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the layout and content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling the clone to capture Spotify’s signature dark theme and aesthetic.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity, such as simulated player controls and search functionality.
