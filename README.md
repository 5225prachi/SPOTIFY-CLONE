A Spotify Clone built using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB that replicates core features of Spotify, including user authentication, music search, playlist creation, and audio playback. It allows users to stream music, create and manage playlists, and search for songs or artists. The project is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. Authentication is handled via OAuth2.0 (or JWT), and audio playback is powered by the Web Audio API or Spotify API integration. Deployed on platforms like Vercel, this clone offers a full-featured music streaming experience.
